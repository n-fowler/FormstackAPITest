I used postman to perform manual testing.

Scenario: Get all forms on the account

I used the page at https://developers.formstack.com/docs/form-get to create the postman
PostmanCreationExample.png shows the postman creation.  Other postmans follow this basic format.
The full postman is also stored in ManualTests > Postman with the oauth token removed

Scenario: Get a specific form on the account

I used the page at https://developers.formstack.com/docs/form-id-get to create the postman

Scenario: Copy a form from the account

I used the page at https://developers.formstack.com/docs/form-id-copy-post to create the postman

Scenario: Delete the copied form from the account

I used the page at https://developers.formstack.com/docs/form-id-delete to create the postman

Additional Notes:

I updated the API to add a deleteForm method for the last test
